#   1. News prose carries NO geometry. There are no coordinates for "the
#      Salah al-Din road is cut", so blockages are reported as a list and a
#      feasibility signal, never drawn as lines on the map.
#   2. The status below is keyword-derived from the headline and snippet, not
#      verified. It is a triage hint that points at a source to read.

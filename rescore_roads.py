"""Re-apply the road relevance gate to already-baked snapshots. Costs nothing.

Snapshots fetched before a gate fix hold items that the current rules would
reject — most importantly for "CAR" and "DRC", whose abbreviations produced no
place token, which disabled the location check entirely and let unrelated news
score as road obstruction.

This re-filters the stored items and recomputes counts and signal locally. It
can only ever *remove* items: anything the old gate discarded was never written
to the file, so a crisis whose gate has since become more permissive (the new
Gaza / West Bank aliases, for example) stays under-counted until it is
re-fetched. Those are reported at the end so they can be refreshed when API
credits allow.

Usage:
    python3 rescore_roads.py --dry-run   # report changes, write nothing
    python3 rescore_roads.py             # apply

# Backlog

Known gaps, in the order they would mislead a reader. Each entry says what is
wrong, why it matters, and what closing it would take — so an item can be picked
up without re-deriving the problem.

The road-access layer dominates this list because it is the newest and the least
verifiable: it reads news prose for a fact — whether a route is passable — that
no open global feed publishes, and it feeds a penalty into the CERAI feasibility
score. Everything here was found by auditing the 23 stored road items in
July 2026; the [gate and classifier fixes](server.py) from that audit removed
roughly two thirds of them, and these are what survived.

## Road access — data quality

### 1. The 60-day window is not enforced

The popup says reports are "over the last 60 days". Three stored items are
older: an IOM planning document at 226 days, a SCIAF Malawi item at 156, and an
FPRI analysis at 90 whose subject is a border closure from **2023**. Tavily's
`days` parameter is passed but evidently not honoured for every result, and
nothing downstream checks.

Two items also carry no `published_date` at all, so they cannot be placed in or
out of any window.

**Why it matters.** A three-year-old commodity-export border closure is
currently one of Niger's road-access reports. On a map read for whether people
can leave *today*, a stale item is worse than a missing one.

**To close.** Drop items whose `published_date` falls outside `query_days` in
`tavily_roads`, label undated ones as undated rather than silently keeping them,
and re-run `rescore_roads.py`. Cheap and offline.

### 2. Source quality is unchecked

DRC's only pin — and therefore its entire −2-point feasibility penalty — is a
`wikitravel.org` "Travel news" index page, a link dump that happens to mention
Congo and floods. Two other items are `facebook.com` posts. The relevance gates
judge the *text*; nothing judges the publisher.

**To close.** An allow/deny list of domains, or a minimum standard (wire
services, major outlets, UN/OCHA/IOM/NGO reporting), applied before
classification. Needs a judgment call on where the line sits — reliefweb and
local-language outlets must not be excluded along with the aggregators.

### 3. De-duplication misses re-headlined wire copy

`_is_duplicate` catches identical URLs and near-identical headlines at 0.75
token overlap. The AP and Greenwich Time versions of the same Abdin dispatch
share only ~45% of their headline words and are both counted, which is most of
why Syria now carries the highest signal on the map (0.76, −9 points).

The threshold is deliberately high: merging two genuinely distinct blockages
would *understate* obstruction, the one error this tool must not make. So this
is a known, chosen under-reach, not an oversight.

**To close.** Match on the wire dateline in the snippet ("ABDIN, Syria (AP) —")
rather than the headline, which survives re-titling. Falls back to the current
rule where no dateline is present.

### 4. Cross-crisis duplicates are invisible

A single URL can be counted under two neighbouring crises. The el-Obeid case
that prompted this was a place-gate bug and is fixed, but the general case is
legitimate — one story really can bear on two crises — so it should be
*surfaced*, not suppressed.

**To close.** Have `build_roads_layer.py` report URLs appearing under more than
one crisis, and mark them in the popup so a reader knows the same report is
being counted twice.

### 5. Some items are not about roads at all

Syria carries "Airstrike killed senior ISIS commander in Syria" as `blocked`.
It passes the subject gate on incidental words and the place gate correctly. The
keyword classifier has no notion of what the *sentence* is about.

**To close.** Properly, this wants a model call over the snippet rather than
another regex. That is a real cost decision — one call per item on top of the
existing Tavily credit — and should be weighed against simply showing fewer,
better-sourced items.

### 6. Attribution: the pin names a party, not a place

Eritrea's only report concerns routes into **Tigray, Ethiopia**; Eritrea appears
because it is named as one of the parties closing them. The place gate passes it
correctly — the country really is in the text — but the road access being
described is in a different country from the pin.

**To close.** No clean rule. Worth flagging in the popup when the only match is
the country name and the item names another country's sub-national area.

---

## Road access — coverage

### 7. 62 of 104 crises have never been searched

The largest single gap, and the layer states it: an unpinned crisis is ambiguous
between *searched, nothing found* and *never searched*, and the silent reading —
no pin, roads fine — is the dangerous one.

**To close.** `python3 snapshot_roads.py` (1 Tavily credit per crisis), then
`python3 build_roads_layer.py`, then commit `snapshot/`.

### 8. 20 crises should be re-fetched after the gate changes

`rescore_roads.py` can only ever *remove* items — anything the old gate rejected
was never written to disk. Crises whose alias set has since expanded were
searched under a stricter rule than the one now in force and may be
under-counted. The script names them at the end of every run.

---

## Map

### 9. Seven of eight road pins are country-level stand-ins

The pin sits at the crisis, never at the blockage, because news prose carries no
coordinates — that is inherent and the popup says so. But most crises are
themselves located only to a country, because INFORM publishes no affected admin
areas, so the pin stands in for a whole country. The scope chip says which, and
that is the honest limit rather than a defect.

**To close.** Only better upstream data would close it: affected admin areas per
crisis, from INFORM or hand-curated into `geo/locations.csv`.

## Housekeeping

- `_preview.html` and `_wntest.html` are untracked local scratch files. Decide
  whether either belongs in the repo or in `.gitignore`.
- `data.js` still carries the superseded country-centroid `lat`/`lng`. They are
  no longer read by the map, but they are what `geo/build_geo.py` measures
  corrections against, so removing them is not free.
